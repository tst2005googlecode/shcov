**Note!** the shcov functionality has been integrated into [kcov](http://simonkagstrom.github.io/kcov/), which is maintained and has many more features than shcov. shcov is therefore deprecated, and you should use **kcov** instead.

## Deprecated info ##
shcov is a gcov-like code coverage tester for bourne shell / bash scripts. It also has a [lcov](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php)-like HTML output generator to present coverage results.

The web interface is taken from the [lcov project](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/covrage/lcov.php).
